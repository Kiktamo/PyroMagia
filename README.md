# PyroMagia

A heavily WIP modpack for minecraft centered around the mod Pyrotech.

This particular instance is mostly primitive technology and magic. 

After all of the various scripts, configurations, and other assorted integrations are done I plan on making another branch that will have more technology and probably leave this mostly as is at that point in time.

I might put this on curseforge at some point but as of now I don't feel this is far enough along for that. 

This is mostly just here for if someone wants to use any of the work I've done here to save sometime If they want to do something similar.

## Goals and Focus

Generally speacking the goals behind my changes and additions are mostly just to add integration between mods and make the progression consistent with the basic progression within Pyrotech itself. 

Overall I'd say my guiding standard with this is just "Maintain Logical Consistancy." 

That is to say If something is magical I'll add the Praecantatio Aspect from thaumcraft to it. 

If it can be crushed and isn't to hard of a material add a roots mortar and pestle recipe for it. 

If it's from a mod but similar to something you can duplicate with the conjuration catalyst in botania then add a recipe with costs similar to what that vanilla items cost is.

If it's related to the stars and celestial bodies find some way to connect it to Astral Sorcery...Somehow.

Those are just some of the thought processes that have gone into what I've done so far and intend to keep doing.

## End

That's all. This text in and of itself isn't intended to be to serious and honestly just like how this pack itself is mostly something I'm making for myself, This repository is also something I'm mostly making to familiarize myself with Github a little more.
